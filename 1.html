<!--Looks like you're ready to get making with Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things:

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Pitt Fuego introductory tools (Electrate Fuego or I Am...A Project in Becoming), please do so. These programs will give you the basic skills to use this webtext generator.
2. Add content from code repository at the bottom of this file. Copy and paste from <div> to </div>.
3. Pay attention to file management - keep your asset names simple or use camel case.
4. Make sure your code matches your asset/file type. Code is case sensitive,
5. Describe all images and clearly label links and buttons for accessibility  purposes.
6. Consult w3.org when your code needs to do more than it does.
7. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z...
8. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

  <h2>Welcome to our PRT training manual!</h2>
    <h3>Students have historically had a hard time learning the PRT system when they first arrive at Pitt, we've all had trouble with the bus system at some point or another. With this guide, students can quickly gain a thorough understanding of Pittsburgh's public transportation system without the hassle of having to miss the bus in the process of learning. In this guide you'll be able to learn the bus system, the T, how to use POGOH bikes and how to navigate the changes in the PRT system as they are rolled out.</h3>



  <h2>Q & A</h2>
  <h3>Q: Where can I find more Information about PRT's changing routes?<br>A: You kind find all of PRT's redesign information at engage.rideprt.org !<br>Q: I'm not a student/I don't have access to free fares. How can I pay for the bus?<br>A: You can use cash, purchase fares on PRT's website or app, or utilize the built in fare system on the Transit App to pay for your ride!<br>Q: I feel like the POGOH app is going to charge me. Are you SURE this promo code thing works?<br>Yes! We used one of our collaborators as a guinea pig. She didn't have the app because she can't ride a bike, and while she was terrified of being charged, the promo code worked and she is now able to use the app (if she could ride a bike, that is).</h3>

    <h2>The Future of PRT</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>PRT is currently in the process of developing a new bus system - with redesigned routes to better serve Pittsburgh residents. After the pandemic, the need for routes to Downtown decreased significantly, but the need to connect underserved communities to the surrounding areas increased. Because of this, the main goal of this redesign is to pull routes away from Downtown and connect communities without the need for transfers.</h3>
  <h3>The project is still in its drafting stage but is likely to be implemented as early as 2026! PRT is looking for feedback from the community, so if you want to look at their proposed draft, you can find it here: <a href="https://engage.rideprt.org/buslineredesign">https://engage.rideprt.org/buslineredesign</a>.</h3>
  <h3>If you want to view what changes are being made to individual routes, you can see the changes side by side for any line using this page: <a href="https://engage.rideprt.org/buslineredesign/draftnetwork1-findmyroute">https://engage.rideprt.org/buslineredesign/draftnetwork1-findmyroute</a>.</h3>
