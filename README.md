# Buses, Trolleys, and Bikes! Oh My!
## A Guide to the PRT System

Students have historically had a hard time learning the PRT system when they first arrive at Pitt, we've all had trouble with the bus system at some point or another. With this guide, students can quickly gain a thorough understanding of Pittsburgh's public transportation system without the hassle of having to miss the bus in the process of learning. In this guide you'll be able to learn the bus system, the T, how to use POGOH bikes and how to navigate the changes in the PRT system as they are rolled out. 

## Collaborators
  Will and Sahil focused on the back end work, creating the html website and doing the coding necessary for the project. Grace and Cynthia primarily completed any content or documentation needed for the project (including this READ ME!). Felipe worked on both ends, providing help with documentation and coding where needed - a real Jack of All Trades!

Thank you to all of our wonderful collaborators and all the great work they did for this project!

## Project & Version History

In Here, I'll give all the boring information about how this project developed and the version history (lame!!!)

## Q & A
Q: Where can I find more Information about PRT's changing routes?

A: You kind find all of PRT's redesign information at engage.rideprt.org !

Q: I'm not a student/I don't have access to free fares. How can I pay for the bus?

A: You can use cash, purchase fares on PRT's website or app, or utilize the built in fare system on the Transit App to pay for your ride!

Q: I feel like the POGOH app is going to charge me. Are you SURE this promo code thing works?

A: Yes! We used one of our collaborators as a guinea pig. She didn't have the app because she can't ride a bike, and while she was terrified of being charged, the promo code worked and she is now able to use the app (if she could ride a bike, that is).

## Inclusivity Statement
  Roles for this project were determined at our first meeting, and re-established each time we met to discuss the project and our work. Roles and Tasks were agreed upon by all group members and were determined to be split fairly among our five collaborators.
